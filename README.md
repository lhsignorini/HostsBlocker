I created the 

# HostsBlocker 🛡️

because I was tired of trying to find good website blockers add-ons for opera browser.

This one is very simple, it's a a modern Python-based tool that allows you to block/unblock websites with checkbox-based toggling that directly alters the Windows hosts file. 


## 🚀 Features
✅ Modern UI with `ttkbootstrap` (install this) 
✅ Checkbox for enabling/disabling sites  
✅ Auto-flush DNS after modifications  
✅ Secure backup of hosts file  

## 🔧 Requirements
Install dependencies before running:
pip install ttkbootstrap

## 🛠️ How to run
*You need to run it on admin to work*
python HostsBlocker.py or via .exe file

## 📦 How to cnvert to EXE
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed HostsBlocker.py
